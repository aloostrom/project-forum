# CIS480 Capstone

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.1.

## NPM Install

Install NPM in the root directory. You will also need to install NPM in the /node-rest-api folder

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Database Setup

In order to sample full functionality of the app, create a new MongoDB database called 'cis480'. Create collections within this database with the following names:

<ul>
    <li>closedPosts</li>
    <li>contractors</li>
    <li>openPosts</li>
    <li>reportedPosts</li>
    <li>reviews</li>
    <li>users</li>
</ul>
After creating the collections, import the JSON files in /mongoDB-assets matching each collection.

## All-in-one start

Run the task "start all" to launch the API and Angular front end at the same time.
